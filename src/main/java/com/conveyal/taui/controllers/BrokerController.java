/**
 * This is a Spark HTTP controller to handle connections from workers reporting their status and requesting work.
 * It also handles connections from the front end for single-point requests.
 * This API replaces what used to be a separate broker process running outside the Analysis backend.
 *
 * Workers used to long-poll and hold connections open, allowing them to receive tasks instantly, as soon as the tasks
 * are enqueued. However, this adds a lot of complexity since we need to suspend the open connections and clear them
 * out when the connections are closed. I am now having the workers short-poll, which allows a simple, standard
 * HTTP API. We don't care if it takes a few seconds for workers to start consuming regional tasks.
 *
 * The long polling originally only existed for high-priority tasks and has been extended to single point
 * tasks, which we will instead handle with a proxy-like push approach.
