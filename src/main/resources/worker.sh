# Downloads and runs an analyst worker.
# This shell script undergoes variable substitution via the Java MessageFormat class before being passed to newly
# started worker machines via the AWS EC2 user data. MessageFormat will replace special tokens (consisting of numbers
# inside curly braces) with configuration information specific to the worker being started. These are:
# 0: the URL to grab the worker JAR from
# 1: the AWS log group to use
# 2: the worker configuration to use
# 3: a string containing all tags to set on the worker in the format "Key=K0,Value=V0 Key=K1,Value=V1"
# If you are reading this comment inside the EC2 user data field, this variable substitution has already happened.
# Shell variable references that contain brackets are single-quoted to tell MessageFormat not to substitute them, and
# are substituted by EC2 on startup. Be very careful not to put any stray single quotes in this file, even in comments!
